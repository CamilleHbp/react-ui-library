# react-ui-library

This is a template repository to make a UI library using React, Styled-components, Typescript, WebPack and Storybook.

## Project configuration

### Planned

The build will be made by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) because it is one of the most common build tools.
It can be massive and slow, so I will use [esbuild-loader](https://github.com/privatenumber/esbuild-loader), which uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for the build or minification step.

### Typescript

The project compiles using TSC.

### NPM

The project using Yarn and NPM for the package management.
